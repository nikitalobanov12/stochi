- **Name:** **Stochi** (pronounced _Stow-Key_)
  - _Etymology:_ Short for **Stoichiometry**—the branch of chemistry that calculates the _quantitative relationships_ (ratios) between reactants.
  - _Why it fits:_ Your app’s core differentiator is checking **ratios** (e.g., Zinc:Copper ratio), not just binary conflicts. You are bringing "Stoichiometry to Supplementation."
- **Slogan:** "Balance your chemistry."
- **The Core Problem:** **"The Ratio Failure."**
  - Most interactions aren't "bad"—they are just "imbalanced." You are taking 50mg of Zinc but only 1mg of Copper, creating a competitive deficiency that no basic WebMD checker will flag.
- **Elevator Pitch:**
  > "Biology is not magic; it’s math. Stochi is the first 'Stoichiometric Engine' for bio-optimization. While other apps track what you take, Stochi calculates the molecular ratios of your stack to prevent competitive absorption. It ensures your inputs actually result in the correct biological outputs, rather than expensive chemical imbalances."

# Stochi\_ Brand Style Guide (v1.0)

## 1. Core Identity

- **Name:** `stochi` (Lowercase preferred in UI/logos)
- **Pronunciation:** _Stow-Key_
- **Metaphor:** The "Pharmacological Compiler."
- **Vibe:** CLI tool, IDE, Dark Mode, Precision Instrumentation, "Terminal Chic."

## 2. Color Palette (Dark Mode First)

The palette is inspired by terminal syntax highlighting. The background isn't pure black, but a deep, rich charcoal to reduce eye strain. The accent colors are neon-bright to pop against the dark background, signifying "active" data or "successful" compilations.

### Primary Backgrounds

- **`#0D1117` (GitHub Dark)** - Main background color. Deep, cool gray.
- **`#161B22` (Terminal BG)** - Secondary background for cards, modals, or sidebars. Subtle contrast from the main background.

### Primary Accents (The "Synthesis" Colors)

These colors represent the two elements coming together in your logo. They should be used for primary buttons, successful states, and key data visualizations.

- **`#39FF14` (Neon Terminal Green)** - The "Go" color. Represents successful bonding, optimized ratios, and positive data.
- **`#00F0FF` (Cyber Cyan)** - The "Link" color. Represents data streams, connections, and active processes.

### Functional Colors (UI States)

- **`#FF3860` (Compiler Error Red)** - Used for conflicts, critical warnings (e.g., "0% Absorption detected").
- **`#FFDD57` (Warning Yellow)** - Used for sub-optimal timing or minor interactions.
- **`#C9D1D9` (Primary Text)** - Off-white for high readability without glaring.
- **`#8B949E` (Secondary Text)** - Muted gray for labels, timestamps, and supporting text.

## 3. Typography (The "Code" Aesthetic)

The font choice is crucial. It must feel monospaced and technical, even when it isn't strictly monospaced, to evoke a coding environment.

### Primary Font Family (Headlines & UI)

[**JetBrains Mono**](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) (Free, open-source).

- _Why:_ It’s the gold standard for developer fonts. It’s clean, has excellent readability for complex data, and includes programming ligatures (e.g., `>`, `!=`) which subliminally reinforce the "tool" vibe.
- _Usage:_ Logo, H1-H6 headlines, buttons, data tables, and navigation.

### Secondary Font Family (Body Copy - Optional)

[**Inter**](https://rsms.me/inter/) (Free, open-source).

- _Why:_ While JetBrains Mono is great for data, Inter is better for longer paragraphs of text (like onboarding screens or blog posts). It pairs perfectly with monospaced fonts because it has a tall x-height and a technical feel.
- _Usage:_ Long-form descriptions, help text, blog articles.

### Type Hierarchy Example

- **H1 Headline:** JetBrains Mono Bold, 32px (`#C9D1D9`)
  - `Running Diagnostics...`
- **H2 Subhead:** JetBrains Mono Medium, 20px (`#8B949E`)
  - `Analyzing Stack Interactions`
- **Body Text:** Inter Regular, 16px (`#C9D1D9`)
  - Your 50mg Zinc intake is currently blocked by the tannins in your morning coffee.

## 4. Logo & Iconography Usage

The logo is a functional representation of the product's core value: **connecting two disparate elements into an optimized whole.**

- **The Mark:** The two connected geodesic spheres.
  - The **left sphere** should always be **Neon Green** (`#39FF14`).
  - The **right sphere** should always be **Cyber Cyan** (`#00F0FF`).
  - The connecting "data stream" is a gradient between the two.
- **The Wordmark:** `stochi_`
  - Always rendered in **JetBrains Mono**.
  - Always lowercase.
  - The terminal cursor underscore (`_`) is mandatory. It should ideally have a slow blinking animation in digital formats to emphasize it's an "active terminal."
- **Clear Space:** Maintain a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the letter 's'. Do not crowd it with other elements.
- **Incorrect Usage:**
  - Do not render the logo in a single color (unless absolutely necessary for black-and-white print). The two-tone interaction is key to the meaning.
  - Do not remove the underscore.
  - Do not use a non-monospaced font for the wordmark.
